The wholesale customer segmentation problem is an issue of concern to most wholesale distributors in the business world. Classification of customers is fundamental since it enables marketing teams to have customized strategies meant for different groups of customers.Being able to understand customer behaviour and patterns together with spending habits is key to strategizing. This influences better selling of products hence revenue to a business.
Our case study is centered in Lisbon, Oporto and some parts of Portugal where our client supplies products.The data set includes the annual spending in monetary units on diverse product categories.

Model Behaviour as a team will be looking to explore the dataset from Kaggle and use machine learning clustering models to make a customer segmentation.
